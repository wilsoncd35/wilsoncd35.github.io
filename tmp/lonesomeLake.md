## Directions

The following is a customized Google Map to Lonsome Lake. I suggest that you use this link rather than creating a new map. Google Maps by default will give you a different route, down a different forest road, that I have never used. The road the Google gives you may be fine, but I don't know!

Consider seeing [Offline Google Maps](offlineMaps.md) as well. If you are going to venture out to Lonseome Lake, it is highly unlikely you will have cell reception.
